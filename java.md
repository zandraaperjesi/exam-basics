# EXAM: Programming Basics

### Getting Started
 - Fork this repository under your own account
 - Clone the forked repository to your computer
 - Create a `.gitignore` file so generated files won't be committed
 - Commit your progress frequently and with descriptive commit messages
 - All your answers and solutions should go in this repository

### What can I use?
- You can use any resource online, but **please work individually**
- **Don't just copy-paste** your answers and solutions, use your own words instead.
- **Don't push your work** to GitHub until your mentor announces that the time is up

### What is the constructor? When it is used? [2p]
#### Your answer:
[add your answer here]
The constructor is a code in class that initializes an object. When creating a new instance of an object, the constructor is called by saying "new" before the object type.
If a constructor is not provided when implementing a class, Java generates a default constructor.
A constructor can also make the object be able to take arguments.
